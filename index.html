The second I stepped onto the hardwood floor i 'm immediately filled with never ending joy of being where i belong. The first time i stepped on the hardwood floor and got to hold the basketball in my palms made me feel like i 'm in control. I can do no wrong on the court, every move i make, every shot i take is the right thing to do. The court and the ball have no lack of faith no fear nor pressure. The second i lace my shoes up and step onto the court all my struggles in life completly dissapear.

     <p>Dance ...... this word make me feel some vibration. But for the first time I got much tensed when hear this word because it was dance competition performed by me on the stage in fornt my whole school.. I was nervous and tensed. My body became so cool. After few minutes my dance performance will be started. They announced my name on to the stage. I stepped on the stage and my body was shevering. And that moment I just recalled how hard I fought for this opportunity. And then I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. And by closing my I started dancing. My friends were encouraging me and I got some hope. But even I was a bit tensed. I danced with closed eyes till the end. Then I heard some clapping sound and my last step. My teachers and students were standing and clapping. This moment my hard work my sweat was full vanished..... And I only had a big smile on my face.And at the end the program I was called to stage and was a given a medal from my principal and the cheif guest. My teacher and my friends were so proud of me. I was unable speak even..

  <p> have always been a people person right from my childhood and every friend and family member of mine used to compliment me on my people’s skills like empathy, compassion, altruism, and patience. During my teen years, I slowly and steadily realized that destiny is unfolding the answers to my unresolved questions and I realised after profound analysis and contemplation that careers that involve dealing with people are the best fit for a person like me. I have always been proactive in volunteering activities so I genuinely understand the value of kindness and communication skills. I can clearly recall my school days when my friends used to come up to me for sharing their problems and I used to empathize with them and patiently listen to what they are going through and during those moments, a huge sense of satisfaction dawned upon me when I used to see my friends happy because I helped them feel better.

   <br><br> Instances like these gave a boost to my decision of pursuing a Psychology major in my Bachelors and during my bachelors apart from scoring High marks in my semester exams, I did numerous practical learning based internships, published my research paper on well-being in the workplace, and worked as an HR intern in 3-4 well-known firms to get practical insights into Organizational Psychology. I was an associate member in the Enactus and Placement cell of my college which developed my personality to a great extent and honed my communication skills in the best possible manner.

  <p> In this Thank You For This Award Speech, the awardee can speak in detail about their service in the form of Thank You Speech For Long Speech Award Received.

 

    <br><br>Good morning / evening to everyone present here. Thank you for bestowing me with such an honour and this special award. I feel overwhelmed and emotional and I am at a loss for words, this is a very special moment in my life. It already felt like a win when I found out that I am even being considered for this honorary award.
    
     
    
    <br><br>First of all, let me start by saying I am so grateful to be standing here in front of you with this award. Thank you to the senior authorities of this prestigious institution to recognize my work in all these years. All the contenders for this award, I look up to all of you. You have set the benchmark of excellence for me, and to be on the same list as you were already a great achievement for me.Teaching is always considered to be a selfless profession and many don't even acknowledge our efforts so the fact that our institution hosts an award ceremony for teachers is really commendable. We all are aware that teaching is a tough profession but when the administration, teachers, and parents award us with such a special honour it really solidifies our belief and boosts our morale to continue to do good work.
